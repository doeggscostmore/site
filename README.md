If you're looking at this site on Git Hub, this repository is a mirror from a
private Git / Build server.  I watch issues and the like, but the code is only
synced here a few times per day.

## Contributing

This project is based on Laravel 11, so follow the docs for guidelines and
principals there.  Builds take place on a private server and aren't linked here,
so don't expect any pipeline results to be in your MR.

Feel free to open issues, as noted above I do monitor things here and should
reply in a somewhat timely manner.
